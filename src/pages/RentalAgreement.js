Upon receipt of payment, all final payments are considered non-refundable but transferable in the form of a CREDIT with NO EXPIRY if you cancel up to 31 days prior to arrival.

                        <p>Check-out is at 10 am. Your prompt departure is appreciated so we can prepare the home for any incoming guests. A 1-hour late departure may be arranged pending other reservations and the housekeeping schedule. If you have not arranged for a late checkout, you may be charged $35 for each hour beyond 10 am you are still on the property, at a minimum of one hour. If the home has not been vacated by 3 pm, a fee equal to the rental rate of 2 ½ days may be assessed.</p>

                        <p>Our maximum occupancy refers to the number of people allowed in the home at any given time (ie includes guests & visitors), some of which may be mandated by certain regulations. Exceptions towards the maximum number of people allowed may be made for children under the age of 2. Guest(s) agrees that more than the number of people stated on the reservation shall not occupy the premises. The number of guests includes visitors, even if they are not staying overnight. Unauthorized people at the home at any time will result in a double charge for each additional guest or a maximum occupancy charge (whichever is more), and loss of any security deposit, in addition to any and all damage, disturbance, and cleaning charges. The rental is not intended for parties, nor gatherings at any time of anyone except those who have paid to occupy the property. Exceptions are made on an individual basis – please contact RN for prior approval. If there is excessive noise or music, any illegal activity, or evidence of a violation of these policies, you may be asked to vacate the premise without any refund and additional charges may be assessed. Please inform us of any change in the number of guests before your arrival to avoid these charges and so the home can be prepared appropriately for your group. No exceptions or refunds are given for changes in the number of guests after your arrival.</p>

                        <p>Take a look around the home. If there are concerns or issues with your rental property, please immediately contact our office (leave a message if there is no answer). No refunds or considerations are given unless were notified of problems during your stay. We will provide a form for you to document any pre-existing damage so you won’t be held responsible, as well as a claim form for any damage that happens during your stay (if you purchased the Vacation Rental Damage insurance).</p>

                        <p>Every reservation requires a $79 Property Damage Protection policy (“PDP”). This PDP plan covers unintentional damages to the rental unit interior that occur during your stay, provided they are disclosed to management prior to check out. The policy will pay a maximum benefit of $1,500. Any damages that exceed $1,500 will be charged to the credit card on file. If you damage the real or personal property assigned to your rental accommodation during the trip, the Insurer will reimburse the lesser of the cost of repairs or replacement of the property, up to $1,500.
                        As a condition to the rental of all Vacation Properties, RN reserves the right to charge the Guest’s credit card for any and all uncovered Guest/Invitee caused losses and damages sustained to the Vacation Property throughout the duration of their period of occupancy. In the event of any uncovered Guest/Invitee-caused loss or damage to the Vacation Property, including, but not limited to, undue cleaning, eviction, service calls, service charges, fines/assessments, repairs or replacements, plus all applicable taxes, RN is hereby granted the right to charge the Guest’s credit card. An itemized statement outlining all associated costs will be sent via regular or electronic mail to the address submitted by the Guest at such time as the reservation was booked. By written or electronic endorsement of this Agreement, the Guest hereby agrees to pay for all such charges, as defined above and on the proceeding pages.  </p>
